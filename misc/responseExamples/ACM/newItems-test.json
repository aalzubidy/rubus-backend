    "abstract": "In this position paper, I present my vision on how enhancing the interaction between devices in an Internet of Things (IoT) network and the mechanisms of Software Defined Networking (SDN) can not only improve the efficiency of wirelessly transmitted data but can enhance the viability and manageability of devices in an IoT network and beyond. By expanding the composition of SDN to encompass not only the existing North (controller API), South (device API), East and West interfaces (distributed controller(s) API) - viewed as an X-/Y-axis, but also a holistic adaptive Z-axis which mandates a higher layer abstraction of the root APIs irrespective of the underlying architecture. This adaptive Z-axis improves the global view by offering an abstracted view of the network control and management for all objects in the network. In this proposal all interfaces, irrespective of axis, can be viewed as a single abstraction, by which \"inter-operative function calls\" can be leveraged adaptively between the device(s) and the network(s). By leveraging these additional constructs, I believe that SDN can improve the capabilities and efficiency of IoT networks.",

    "abstract": "With the ever increasing number of IoT devices getting connected, an enormous amount of streaming data is being produced with very high velocity. In order to process these large number of data streams, a variety of stream processing platforms and query engines are emerging. In the stream query processing, an infinite data stream is divided into small chunks of finite data using a window operator. Window size and its type play an important role in the performance of any stream query engine. Due to the dynamic nature of IoT, data stream rate fluctuates very often, thus impeding the performance of query engines. In this work, we investigated the impact of any changes in data stream rates over the performance of a distributed query engine (e.g. Flink - https://flink.apache.org/). Our evaluation results indicate a direct impact of any changes in stream rate and window size over the performance of the engines. We propose an adaptive and dynamic query window size and type selector to improve the resilience of query processing engines. We consider several characteristics of input data streams, application workload, and resource constraints and proposes an optimal stream query window size and type for stream query execution.",

    "abstract": "To continue to grow, the Internet of Things (IoT) requires scalable and secure system software solutions for resource-constrained devices. To maximize return on investment of these devices, IoT platforms should support multiple third-party applications and adaptation of software over time. However, realizing the vision of shared IoT platforms demands not only strong guarantees on the confidentiality and integrity of application data, but also guarantees on the use of critical resources such as computation, sensors and energy. We refer to this vision as resource security . Prior research on Operating Systems (OS) for tiny IoT devices has focused on miniaturizing core functionality such as scheduling and communication and does not consider resource security. To address this problem, we introduce CerberOS, a resource-secure OS for sharing IoT devices. CerberOS enables multiple applications on constrained IoT devices while, for the first time, guaranteeing data confidentiality, integrity and secure resource management. Our approach is based upon the twin pillars of virtualization, which isolates applications, and contracts, which control application resource usage. Evaluation shows that CerberOS supports the secure coexistence of up to seven applications on a representative IoT device with a memory usage of 40KB ROM and 5KB RAM while preserving multi-year battery lifetimes.",

This paper analyzes a few selected ones, which we faced during development of the hardware-software support for two different communication channels for supervising experiments on the testbed. The problems arose despite our employing popular standards and reputed components, minimizing risky features, and following modern quality assurance practices. Moreover, if it had not been for our emphasis on dependability, they would have likely passed undetected and doomed our project. In this light, we believe that the presented lessons we learned the hard way when debugging the problems may be of interest to the community.",

    "abstract": "Controlling asset-access has traditionally been considered a matter for systems in which assets reside. Centralized approaches to access control are, however, problematic for the IoT. One reason for this is that devices may not be confined to a single system of control. In this abstract, we argue for a new paradigm in which assets are empowered to make their own access decisions. To facilitate this shift in perspective, we propose a policy-neutral framework based on principles adapted from object-oriented programming. This approach establishes assets as active, message-passing entities that store and determine their own access control. We describe initial work modelling the interaction of such assets and point to future formal work for reasoning about protocols and policy composition.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) application development is technically challenging and complex due to several factors such as the presence of different IoT protocols, interoperability issues, lack of industry standards and dealing with the heterogeneity that exists both in Physical and Internet worlds. Furthermore, developers involved in the IoT application development have to address issues pertaining to different life-cycles ranging from design, implementation to deployment (deployment complexities due to the possibilities of wide range of devices). Manual effort involved in all above three phases for heterogeneous devices is a time-consuming and error-prone process. We demonstrate IoTSuite which is an application development platform consisting of a suite of tools motivated by the need to simplify IoT application development. The IoTSuite supports several features such as automatic code generation and integration with a set of modeling languages. It takes high-level specification as input that abstract heterogeneity related complexity. It integrates compiler and deployment module to provide automation at different phases of application development process.",

We demonstrate how the master/slave decentralised control pattern for self-adaptive systems, integrated with a permissioned blockchain, can protect nodes of a network against attacks by continuously adapting the membership of an access control list. Whenever malicious behaviour is detected, consensus on an updated access control list is reached, and that node is removed from the network. Using a smart home, as an example, we demonstrate that a permissioned blockchain is able to maintain a consistent view of a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the presence of malicious nodes.",

The main aim of REMI is to enable efficient communication in low-power and lossy networks such as IoT, by ensuring that a message will be received by all its intended destinations, irrespective of the network size and the presence of misbehaving nodes. REMI uses a cluster-based routing approach that triggers a faster multicast dissemination of messages within the network. We implemented REMI with Contiki, a multitasking operating system which is widely adopted by industry for deploying energy-constrained and memory-efficient wireless networks. To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of REMI, we run a thorough set of simulations. Our results show the effectiveness of our protocol over state-of-art protocols in terms of network throughput, propagation delay, and scalability at the cost of minimal overheads in terms of energy consumption and memory utilization.",

    "abstract": "When a self-adaptive system detects that its adaptation goals may be compromised, it needs to determine how to adapt to ensure its goals. To that end, the system can analyze the possible options for adaptation, i.e., the adaptation space, and pick the best option that achieves the goals. Such analysis can be resource and time consuming, in particular when rigorous analysis methods are applied. Hence, exhaustively analyzing all options may be infeasible for systems with large adaptation spaces. This problem is further complicated as the adaptation options typically include uncertainty parameters that can only be resolved at runtime. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to tackle this problem. This approach enhances the traditional MAPE-K feedback loop with a learning module that selects subsets of adaptation options from a large adaptation space to support the analyzer with performing efficient analysis. We instantiate the approach for two concrete learning techniques, classification and regression, and evaluate the approaches for two instances of an Internet of Things application for smart environment monitoring with different sizes of adaptation spaces. The evaluation shows that both learning approaches reduce the adaptation space significantly without noticeable effect on realizing the adaptation goals.",

    "abstract": "It is often the case that analysis, simulation and verification tools from different sources share a lot of commonalities. Even though the syntax might differ, the semantics of the input models are many times the same. Theoretically this means that different tools could either be compared or combined to analyze different aspects of the same model. In practise however, this often leads to time-consuming manual tweaks and modifications on a per model basis. Additionally, the necessary environments, in form of run-times and dependencies required for the tools to be executed, are not always readily available. Images for virtual machines and containers surely ease the process for setting up the context, but this still requires manual plumbing when setting up a work-flow.In this demo a Design Studio for combining different verification tools is show-cased. Building on top of WebGME (Generic Modeling Environment) it provides end-users with an online, browser-based editor where models are stored in a version-controlled, centralized database. At any point of the design process, a model can at the click of a button be requested to act as input for a range of different verification tools such as SpaceEx, Flow* and dReach. The Design Studio is currently hosted at cps-vo.org, but also available as open source and the entire system can, thanks to containerization, be hosted locally with a single command. At the core of this Design Studio lies the HYbrid Source Transformer, HYST, which is hosted as an independent service for translating a common model format, SpaceEx, into each tool-specific format.",

    "abstract": "Formal specification plays crucial roles in the rigorous verification and design of automobile steering systems. The challenge of getting high-quality formal specifications is well documented. This paper presents a problem called 'semantic parsing', the goal of which is to automatically translate the behavior of an automobile steering system to a formal specification written in signal temporal logic (STL) with human-in-the loop manner. To tackle the combinatorial explosion inherent to the problem, this paper adopts a search strategy called agenda-based parsing, which is inspired by natural language processing. Based on such a strategy, the semantic parsing problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then solved using reinforcement learning. The obtained formal specification can be viewed as an interpretable classifier, which, on the one hand, can classify desirable and undesirable behaviors, and, on the other hand, is expressed in a human-understandable form. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated with study.",

This paper presents a stand-off self-referencing technique for detecting unauthorized activity. The proposed technique processes involuntary electromagnetic emissions on a separate hardware, which is physically decoupled from the device under test. When the device enter the test mode, it runs a predefined application repetitively with a fixed period. The periodicity ensures that the spectral electromagnetic power of the test application concentrates at known frequencies, leaving the remaining frequencies within the operation bandwidth at the noise level. Any deviations from the noise level for these unoccupied frequency locations indicates the presence of unknown (unauthorized) activity. Experiments based on hardware measurements show that the proposed technique achieves close to 100% detection accuracy at up to 120 cm distance.",

    "abstract": "Ptolemy is a modeling and simulation toolkit widely used in cyber physical systems. Formal verification is a very important method to guarantee the correctness of systems. However, the proposed verification approach in Ptolemy is inconvenient and only supports a few actors. In this paper, we present a model translation based approach to verify the Ptolemy Discrete-Event model and implement a plug-in tool in Ptolemy. A set of mapping rules are designed to translate the Ptolemy Discrete-Event model into a network of timed automata. A template library that translates from actors in Ptolemy Discrete-Event model is also built in advance. A case study of traffic lights control system has been successfully translated and verified. The verification results are reliable and valid. The experimental results confirm our approach is useful to verify the Ptolemy Discrete-Event model.",

    "abstract": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a critical part of a new defense paradigm providing high flexibility at a lower cost through software-based virtual instances. Despite the promise of the NFV, the original Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed for NFV still draws heavily on processing power and requires significant CPU resources. In this paper, we provide a framework for dynamic defense provision by building in light intrusion detection network functions (NFs) over NFV. Without using the existing IDSes, our system constructs a light intrusion detection system by using a chain of network functions in NFV. The entire IDS is broken down into separate light network functions according to different protocols. The intrusion detection NFs cover various protocol stacks from the link layer to the application layer protocols. They also include different deep packet inspection NFs for different application layer protocols. The experimental results show the proposed system reduces resource consumption while performing valid intrusion detection functions.",

In this paper, we explore the design space of in-network security for smart home networks, which automatically complements existing security mechanisms with a rule-based approach, i. e., every IoT device provides a specification of the required communication to fulfill the desired services. In our approach, the home router as the central network component then enforces these communication rules with traffic filtering and anomaly detection to dynamically react to threats. We show that in-network security can be easily integrated into smart home networks based on existing approaches and thus provides additional protection for heterogeneous IoT devices and protocols. Furthermore, in-network security relieves users of difficult home network configurations, since it automatically adapts to the connected devices and services.",

    "abstract": " The proliferation of independently-developed and constantly-evolving domain-specific languages (DSLs) in many domains raises new challenges for the software language engineering community. Instead of starting the definition of new DSLs from scratch, language designers would benefit from the reuse of previously defined DSLs. While the support for engineering isolated DSLs is getting more and more mature, there is still little support in language workbenches for importing, assembling, and customizing legacy languages to form new ones. Melange is a new language workbench where new DSLs are built by assembling pieces of syntax and semantics. These pieces can be imported and subsequently extended, restricted, or customized to fit specific requirements. The demonstration will introduce the audience to the main features of Melange through the definition of an executable DSL for the design and execution of Internet of Things systems. Specifically, we will show how such a language can be obtained from the assembly of other popular languages while maintaining the compatibility with their tools and transformations. ",

Aiming to stimulate other human sensory receptors such as mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors and thermoceptors, the MulSeMedia increases the degree of immersion of users as well as improves the Quality of Experience and is standardized by MPEG-V. It is currently possible to identify a gap in the definition of processes, methods and tools to support the systematic development of multimedia /multisensory applications in accordance with the MPEG-V standard. The main objective of this work is to propose a Model-driven approach to integrate media, software and sensory effects projects.

    "abstract": "Context: There has been an increasing use of agile techniques for safety-critical systems. Agile techniques embrace fast changing requirements, continuously delivered products and frequent communication with lightweight documentation. Motivation: However, for safety-critical system projects, a lack of safety-related documentation influences the safety-related communication and may reduce the safety assurance's capability. Objective: In this article, we aim to improve the safety-related documentation in a Scrum development process and to support a more efficient safety-related communication. Method: We investigated three types of safety-related documentation patterns in agile development: safety epic, safety story, and agile safety plan. We further adapted and implemented them in a student project at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. We used participant observation, Scrum artifacts, documentation review, and questionnaires combined with interviews to validate this adapted documentation concerning their effect on communication, safety culture, and general impact on organization. Result: The results showed that safety story and safety epic have a positive effect on both internal and external communication. However, the agile safety plan showed little effect on communication. Rather, it has general impact on the safety process overview, priority management, providing a safety backup knowledge as well as having a delivered safety assessment report. Conclusion: To improve safety-related communication in a Scrum development process for safety-critical systems, the safety story and the safety epic are strongly suggested, while an agile safety plan should be further investigated depending on its general impact in various projects.",

    "abstract": "Data is the natural resource of the 21st century. It is being produced at dizzying rates, e.g., for genomics by sequencers, for Media and Entertainment with very high resolution formats, and for Internet of Things (IoT) by multitudes of sensors. Object Stores such as AWS S3, Azure Blob storage, and IBM Cloud Object Storage, are highly scalable distributed storage systems that offer high capacity, cost effective storage for this data. But it is not enough just to store data; we also need to derive value from it. Apache Spark is the leading big data analytics processing engine. It runs up to one hundred times faster than Hadoop MapReduce and combines SQL, streaming and complex analytics. In this poster we present Stocator, a high performance storage connector, that enables Spark to work directly on data stored in object storage systems.",

In Coppelia, we develop a hardware-oriented backward symbolic execution engine with a new cycle stitching method and fast validation technique, along with several optimizations for exploit generation. We then add program stubs to complete the exploit. We evaluate Coppelia on three CPUs of different architectures. Coppelia is able to find and generate exploits for 29 of 31 known vulnerabilities in these CPUs, including 11 vulnerabilities that commercial and academic model checking tools can not find. All of the generated exploits are successfully replayable on an FPGA board. Moreover, Coppelia finds 4 new vulnerabilities along with exploits in these CPUs. We also use Coppelia to verify whether a security patch indeed fixed a vulnerability, and to refine a set of assertions.",

    "abstract": "The Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus is frequently used to connect sensors and actuators to cyber-physical systems. It is designed around always-on pull-up resistors, which transform valuable electric energy into heat whenever a 0-signal is sent or received. Using a software I2C implementation which disables pull-ups when possible, we decrease the energy demand of I2C transmissions at the cost of additional CPU time. On a low-power MSP430FR5969 microcontroller, we observe 10 to 50 % lower whole-system energy usage per transmission compared to conventional software I2C. An advantage over hardware I2C modules is only apparent at bus clocks below 10 kHz.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, our customers have expressed frustration in the traditional approach of using a combination of disparate products to handle their streaming, transactional and analytical needs. The common practice of stitching heterogeneous environments in custom ways has caused enormous production woes by increasing development complexity and total cost of ownership. With SnappyData, an open source platform, we propose a unified engine for real-time operational analytics, delivering stream analytics, OLTP and OLAP in a single integrated solution. We realize this platform through a seamless integration of Apache Spark (as a big data computational engine) with GemFire (as an in-memory transactional store with scale-out SQL semantics). In this demonstration, after presenting a few use case scenarios, we exhibit SnappyData as our our in-memory solution for delivering truly interactive analytics (i.e., a couple of seconds), when faced with large data volumes or high velocity streams. We show that SnappyData can exploit state-of-the-art approximate query processing techniques and a variety of data synopses. Finally, we allow the audience to define various high-level accuracy contracts (HAC), to communicate their accuracy requirements with SnappyData in an intuitive fashion.",

    "abstract": "There has been increased focus on improving the security and efficiency of the electricity grid resources. Many solutions have been proposed. Demand Response (DR) and Demand Side Management (DSM) are popular solutions in studies towards achieving these goals.This paper elucidates on the work being done within a Horizon 2020 (H2020) project, Sim4Blocks, funded by the EU, on the implementation of DR for a group of buildings with thermal and electric demands. The project tackles three issues that are of importance to realization of DR for end-users: (1) What hardware and communication protocols are required to ensure that existing devices (especially thermal devices) can participate in the electricity market? Would it be possible to future-proof the methodology developed? (2) How do we optimise the thermal and electric energy flows such that demand and comfort are satisfied while minimising stress in the electric grid and (3) How do we integrate the optimisation algorithms and associated software with the hardware so that the entire hardware-software framework works seamlessly.With these questions in mind, hardware, communication protocols, Domain Specific Languages (DSL) and optimisation frameworks are utilised and developed such that end-user buildings with thermal and electrical devices can participate in the electricity market.The entire framework developed is validated through demonstration on three pilot sites in three different countries with different sets of devices (Switzerland, Germany and Spain). These sites consisting of end-user buildings that have thermal and electrical devices which are conventionally found in today's market.Thus, through the development and demonstration of such a framework, Sim4Blocks is able to analyse the strengths, weaknesses and bottlenecks existing in today's devices, control methodologies and market constraints and suggest solutions to overcome them.",

While contemporary tools support the deployment of predefined applications, they lack internal support for taking care of changes in application designs. Dealing with this application dynamism in a timely manner requires new development and management techniques. This paper proposes a component-based approach that captures the entire design and runtime management cycle of IaaS applications. First, a component model is introduced that represents virtual computational resources as components and externalises control over their application logic. This model is then applied in a component framework that enables the rapid design of verified applications, and features additional support for the pre-provisioning of generic infrastructure and late configuration of application components. To showcase the capabilities of this approach, it is applied to an elastic media distribution use case.",

    "abstract": "JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages. To understand the behaviors of JavaScript programs and to detect possible errors in them, researchers have developed several static analyzers based on the abstract interpretation framework. However, JavaScript provides various language features that are difficult to analyze statically and precisely such as dynamic addition and removal of object properties, first-class property names, and higher-order functions. To alleviate the problem, JavaScript static analyzers often use recency abstraction, which refines address abstraction by distinguishing recent objects from summaries of old objects. We observed that while recency abstraction enables more precise analysis results by allowing strong updates on recent objects, it is not monotone in the sense that it does not preserve the precision relationship between the underlying address abstraction techniques: for an address abstraction A and a more precise abstraction B, recency abstraction on B may not be more precise than recency abstraction on A. Such an unintuitive semantics of recency abstraction makes its composition with various analysis sensitivity techniques also unintuitive. In this paper, we propose a new singleton abstraction technique, which distinguishes singleton objects to allow strong updates on them without changing a given address abstraction. We formally define recency and singleton abstractions, and explain the unintuitive behaviors of recency abstraction. Our preliminary experiments show promising results for singleton abstraction.",

    "abstract": "In the Big Data context, data streaming systems have been introduced to tame velocity and enable reactive decision making. However, approaching such systems is still too complex due to the paradigm shift they require, i.e., moving from scalable batch processing to continuous analysis and detection. Initially, modern big stream processing systems (e.g., Flink, Spark, Storm) have been lacking the support of declarative languages to express the streaming-based data processing tasks and have been mainly relying on providing low-level APIs for the end-users to implement their tasks. However, recently, this fact has been changing and most of them started to provide SQL-like languages for their end-users.In general, declarative Languages are playing a crucial role in fostering the adoption of Stream Processing. This tutorial focuses on introducing various approaches for declarative querying of the state-of-the-art big data streaming frameworks. In addition, we provide guidelines and practical examples on developing and deploying Stream Processing applications using a variety of SQL-like languages, such as Flink-SQL, KSQL and Spark Streaming SQL.",

Several different devices, which can be connected to the Web of Things, demand efforts to implement specific services to deploy each of such devices. For that reason, this paper presents an approach to automatically publish and configure devices as Web of Things resources. Our approach presents models that implement device functionalities and uses such models to automatically generate Web Services for devices. This paper also presents: i) dynamic discovery and configuration of devices when connecting to a local network by using Zeroconf protocol; ii) automatic generation of applications for publishing devices on the Web of Things.",

    "abstract": "Building a machine learning model is an iterative process. A data scientist will build many tens to hundreds of models before arriving at one that meets some acceptance criteria (e.g. AUC cutoff, accuracy threshold). However, the current style of model building is ad-hoc and there is no practical way for a data scientist to manage models that are built over time. As a result, the data scientist must attempt to \"remember\" previously constructed models and insights obtained from them. This task is challenging for more than a handful of models and can hamper the process of sensemaking. Without a means to manage models, there is no easy way for a data scientist to answer questions such as \"Which models were built using an incorrect feature?\", \"Which model performed best on American customers?\" or \"How did the two top models compare?\" In this paper, we describe our ongoing work on ModelDB, a novel end-to-end system for the management of machine learning models. ModelDB clients automatically track machine learning models in their native environments (e.g. scikit-learn, spark.ml), the ModelDB backend introduces a common layer of abstractions to represent models and pipelines, and the ModelDB frontend allows visual exploration and analyses of models via a web-based interface.",

Hosts with the same heartbeat tend to have the same applications and thus share the homogenous vulnerabilities. Based on the detected heartbeat, the paper designs the heartbeat network, the heartbeat associated graph and an attribute propagation algorithm based on the heartbeat associated graph. The paper takes the distributed denial of service (DDoS) malicious host information provided by the intrusion detection system (IDS) deployed on the boundary of China education and research network (CERNET) Nanjing master node network as attribution, and constructs the associated graph based on the user datagram protocol (UDP) heartbeat detection result at the same location. The attribute propagation algorithm was tested for 17 days. And The result shows that the method can effectively detect DDoS malicious hosts that are not located by IDS.",

Observing the effects of these attacks is helpful in detecting them. In this paper, we show that many attacks on such systems result in a control loop effect we term Process Model Inconsistency (PMI). Our formal approach elucidates the relationships among incompleteness, incorrectness, safety, and inconsistency of process models. We show that incomplete process models lead to inconsistency. Surprisingly, inconsistency may arise even in complete and correct models. We illustrate our approach through an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) example, and describe the practical implications of the theoretical results.",
